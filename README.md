# Dumbluck

Dumb luck trying with bitcoin private keys and wallet addresses generation.

The Script is designed to randomly generate Bitcoin private keys and test corresponding wallets for any balance.
Actually, anyone running rigs and mining farms can install the script for possible bonus discovery of a non-empty wallet.

Dependencies: 
- PHP enabled webserver;
- BitWasp\Bitcoin library;
- http://Blockchain.info/address/... engine availability for checking balances.
